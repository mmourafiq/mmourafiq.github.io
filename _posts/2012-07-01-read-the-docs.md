Many hackers are familiar with the amazing [readthedocs](http://readthedocs.org/), the website that hosts beautiful html documentation for numerous open source project. However, few are those who know that the website also hosts pdf versions of every project documentation.

Indeed, the website generates automatically a PDF version of the project documentation for every version uploaded.

For example the url to the [django documentaion](http://readthedocs.org/projects/django)â€™s pdf version:

[media.readthedocs.org/pdf/django/latest/django.pdf](http://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/django/latest/django.pdf)

You can replace django with the slug for any Read the Docs project.
